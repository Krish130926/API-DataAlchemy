# Ethical Considerations for Cryptocurrency Price and News Scraper

## Data Collection
- **API Usage**: The project utilizes the CoinGecko API and NewsAPI, both of which have clear terms of service. The project adheres to these guidelines, ensuring that data is retrieved in a manner that complies with usage policies.

## User Privacy
- **No Personal Data**: The script does not collect any personal user data. It only gathers publicly available information from the APIs and presents it to the user.

## Transparency
- **Attribution**: The project credits the data sources used (CoinGecko and NewsAPI) within the README file, ensuring users are aware of where the data is coming from.

## Rate Limiting
- **Respect for API Limits**: The script includes rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the APIs with requests, which could potentially lead to service disruptions or bans. This respects the resources of the API providers.

## Ethical Implications of Cryptocurrency News
- **Responsible Reporting**: The script focuses on gathering news that is relevant to cryptocurrency markets, aiming to provide users with information that can help them make informed decisions. However, users should critically evaluate the sources of the news articles and the context in which the information is presented.

## Conclusion
By adhering to these ethical guidelines, the project aims to provide a valuable resource while respecting the rights and responsibilities associated with data collection and reporting.
